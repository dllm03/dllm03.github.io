## Tech Stack
AWS Lambda, React, PostgreSQL

## Problem
Group of school mom's in group chats always asking for referrals of services, but it is all lost in hundreds of messages. The app can identify those referrals and create a DB of shareable knowledge so they don't always have to ask for the same contact over and over again.

## Solution

- Developed a mobile app that parses WhatsApp chat messages to extract service referrals (e.g., plumbers, electricians)
- Automatically organizes referrals into a searchable contact list categorized by profession and location
- Implemented backend automation using AWS Lambda for message processing and PostgreSQL for data storage

## Key Features

- **Message Parsing**: Intelligent extraction of contact information from chat messages
- **Categorization**: Automatic organization by profession and location
- **Search**: Quick lookup of previously shared referrals
- **Cloud-Based**: Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda for scalability
