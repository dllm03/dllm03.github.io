**Tech Stack:** 
AWS Lambda, React, PostgreSQL  
**Problem:** 
Group of schoool mom's in group chats always asking for referrals of services, but it is all lost in hundreds of message. The app can identify those referrals and create a DB of shareabl knowledge so they don't always have to ask for the same contact over and over again.
**Solution:**
 · Developed a mobile app that parses WhatsApp chat messages to extract service referrals (e.g., plumbers, electricians).
 · Automatically organizes referrals into a searchable contact list categorized by profession and location.
 · Implemented backend automation using AWS Lambda for message processing and PostgreSQL
