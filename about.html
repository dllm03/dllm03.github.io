      <h3>🚀 What I'm Passionate About</h3>
      <p>
          I’m passionate about building practical, scalable solutions that bridge technology and real business
          outcomes. My work sits at the intersection of software delivery, automation, data, and product thinking,
          where I enjoy turning complex problems into systems that are reliable, measurable, and easy to use.
      </p>
      <p>
          I’m especially motivated by digital transformation with purpose—modernizing processes and platforms
          in ways that actually improve how teams work. I enjoy reducing friction through automation and
          integration, enabling data-driven decision making, and helping teams adopt new tools and ways of
          working with confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
          At the core, I value collaboration, rapid experimentation, and continuous refinement—turning ideas
          into solutions that deliver meaningful and sustainable impact.
      </p>
